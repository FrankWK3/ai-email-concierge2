## Decision Priority Ladder (Order Matters)

The concierge evaluates emails in the following order and stops at the first matching rule:

1. INTERRUPT NOW  
   - Replies to conversations I initiated
   - Personal, professional, or service/support responses
   - These trigger immediate notification

2. NOTIFY (NON-URGENT)  
   - Human relationship emails from known contacts
   - Messages that benefit from timely acknowledgment but do not require interruption

3. LOG SILENTLY  
   - Transactional confirmations, receipts, statements
   - Important records with no immediate action required

4. BATCH FOR LATER  
   - Newsletters, market briefs, informational updates
   - Reviewed during designated batch windows only

5. IGNORE / AUTO-ARCHIVE  
   - Promotions, cold outreach, low-value automated emails
## Stop Rule

Once an email matches a priority level, no further rules are evaluated.
This prevents over-processing and conflicting actions.
# Email Policy

## Notification philosophy
- Default: no immediate interruption.
- Immediate notifications are reserved for replies to conversations I initiated.

## High-priority interrupt rule (core)
Notify immediately if:
- The email is a reply to an email I sent (thread I initiated), AND
- It is from:
  - a personal contact, OR
  - a professional contact, OR
  - a service/support inbox responding to my inquiry (e.g., support@, billing@, help@).

## Common handling rules (initial)
### Transactional / receipts (e.g., trade confirmations)
- Notify: No
- Action: archive/label for records
- Rationale: important record, not time-sensitive

### Personal messages from known contacts
- Notify: Yes (non-urgent)
- Urgency: usually Medium
- Action: suggest a short, thoughtful reply
- Rationale: relationship maintenance matters; avoid ignoring humans

### Newsletters / market briefs
- Notify: No
- Action: batch for later skim or summarize
- Rationale: low marginal value daily; reduce attention leaks
