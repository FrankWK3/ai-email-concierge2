# Email Policy

## Notification philosophy
- Default: no immediate interruption.
- Immediate notifications are reserved for replies to conversations I initiated.

## High-priority interrupt rule (core)
Notify immediately if:
- The email is a reply to an email I sent (thread I initiated), AND
- It is from:
  - a personal contact, OR
  - a professional contact, OR
  - a service/support inbox responding to my inquiry (e.g., support@, billing@, help@).

## Common handling rules (initial)
### Transactional / receipts (e.g., trade confirmations)
- Notify: No
- Action: archive/label for records
- Rationale: important record, not time-sensitive

### Personal messages from known contacts
- Notify: Yes (non-urgent)
- Urgency: usually Medium
- Action: suggest a short, thoughtful reply
- Rationale: relationship maintenance matters; avoid ignoring humans

### Newsletters / market briefs
- Notify: No
- Action: batch for later skim or summarize
- Rationale: low marginal value daily; reduce attention leaks
